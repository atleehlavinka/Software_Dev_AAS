                    <p class="">Mountain Man Apparel was founded in 1982 by a group of friends that loved backpacking together. United by their love for the outdoors, they decided to source quality items that were also affordable for their community. Soon, one location became two, then three, and the rest is history.</p>
                    <p class="">Because we are a privately held company, we have no shareholders to please. And because we have the freedom to make our own choices as a company we donate half of all profits to charities targeted at preserving wildlife and the outdoors. This means that when you make a purchase we making an impact together to keep the wild untamed for future generations.</p>
                    <p class="">We strive to give you a premium shopping experience. See you on the trail!</p>
